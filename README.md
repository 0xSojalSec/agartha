# Agartha { LFI | RCE | Auth | SQLi | Http-Js }
Agartha is a penetration testing tool which creates dynamic payload lists and user access matrix to find injection flaws and authentication/authorization issues. Also it converts Http requests to JavaScript to help digging up XSS issues more. Features:

- **Payload Generator**: It creates payloads/wordlist against different attacks.
	- **Directory Traversal/Local File Inclusion**: It creates dynamic dictionary list with various encoding and escaping characters.
	- **Remote Code Execution**: It creates dynamic dictionary list for both unix and windows environments with different combinations.
	- **SQL Injection Boolean-based**: It creates static boolean based SQLi dictionary list to help revealing vulnerable spots.
- **Authorization Matrix**: It creates an acccess role matrix based on user sessions and helps to find auhtorization/authentication related issues.
- And **Http Request to JavaScript Converter**: It converts Http requests to JavaScript code and might be useful for digging up XSS issues more.



Here is a small tutorial how to use.
## Installation
You can install Agartha via official Burp Store automaticly. For manual installation, you should download 'jython' file first, and then:
- Extender > Options > Python Environment > Location of jython standalone jar file
- Extender > Extensions > Add > Extension Type: Python > Select file: 'agartha.py'

## Directory Traversal/Local File Inclusion
It both supports unix and windows file systems. You can generate any wordlists for the path you want. You just need to supply a file path and that's all. 

**'Depth'** is represantion of how deep the wordlist should be. You can generates word list 'till/equal to' this value.

**'Waf Bypass'** asks for if you want to include all bypass features, like null bytes, different encoding, etc.

## Remote Code Execution
It creates command exection word list for the command you supply. It combines different sepetator and terminator for unix and windows enviorments together.

## SQL Injection Boolean-based
It is for boolean based SQLi attacks and you dont need to supply any inputs. It generates static, vendor-neutral true and false criterias with escaping chacters and  appliaple for Mysql, Mssql, Oracle, Mariadb, PostgreSQL, etc.

## Authorization Matrix
It creates an access maxtrix based on user sessions/URL list, and helps to find authentication/authorization issues. You should first supply rows and columns information:
- **User session name**: You can right click on any request and send it Agartha Panel.
- **URL list** user can visit: You can use Burp's spider or any sitemap generator. You need to put here all URLs the user can visit.

After sending Http request to Agartha, it will fill some fields in the tool and wait for the next step. 
1. What's username for the session you provide. You can add up to 4 different users and each user will have a different color to make it easy to read.
2. User's request header. Session calls will be based on it.
3. URLs the user can visit. You can create this list with manual effort or automatic tools, like spiders, sitemap generators, etc, and do not forget to remove logout links.
4. All URLs you supply will be in here. Also user cell will be colored if it is in the user's list.
5. Http requests and responses wihout authentication. All session cookies and tokens will be removed form the calls.
6. Http requests and responses with the user session you created in the first step. Cell titles show Http response codes and response lenghts. 
7. Just click the cell you want to examine and Http details will be shown in here.

After clicking 'RUN', the tool will fill user and URL matrix with different colors. Besides the user colors, you will see orange, yellow and red cells.
- The cell is Yellow, because the response returns 'HTTP 302' with authentication/authorization concerns
- The cell is Orange, because the response returns 'HTTP 200' but different content length, with authentication/authorization concerns
- The cell is Red, because the response returns 'HTTP 200' and same content length, with authentication/authorization concerns

It will be quite similar, even if we add more users. Any authorization concerns will be highlighted.

You may also notice, it support only one http request method and header at the same time, because it processes bulk requests and it is not possible to provide different header options for each calls. But you change play with 'GET/POST' methods to see response differences.


## Http Request to JavaScript Converter
The feature is for converting Http requests to JavaScript language. It can be useful to dig up XSS issues and bypass header restrictions, like CSP, CORS.

To access it, right click the Http Request, Extensions, 'Agartha', and 'Copy as JavaScript'.

It will automaticly save it to your clipboard with some remarks. For example:
```
Http request with minimum header paramaters in JavaScript:
	<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('POST','http://vm:80/dvwa/login.php');xhr.withCredentials=true;xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');xhr.send('username=admin&password=password&Login=Login');</script>

Http request with all header paramaters in JavaScript:
	<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('POST','http://vm:80/dvwa/login.php');xhr.withCredentials=true;xhr.setRequestHeader('Host',' vm');xhr.setRequestHeader('User-Agent',' Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:97.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/97.0');xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept',' */*');xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept-Language',' en-US,en;q=0.5');xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept-Encoding',' gzip, deflate');xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type',' application/x-www-form-urlencoded');xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-Length',' 44');xhr.setRequestHeader('Origin',' http://vm');xhr.setRequestHeader('Connection',' close');xhr.setRequestHeader('Referer',' http://vm/dvwa/login.php');xhr.send('username=admin&password=password&Login=Login');</script>

For redirection, please also add this code before '</script>' tag:
	xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){if (this.status===302){var location=this.getResponseHeader('Location');return ajax.call(this,location);}};
```
Please note that, the JavaScript code will be called over original user session and many header fields will be filled automaticly. In some cases, the server may require some header field mendatory, and therefore you may need to modify the code for an adjustment.
