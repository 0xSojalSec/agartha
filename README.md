# agartha { LFI | RCE | Auth | SQLi | Http-Js }
agartha is a burp extension for penetration testing and it is aimed to help researchers to find security issues. It creates dynamic word lists, access role matrix and more:
- **Local File Inclusion/Directory Traversal wordlist**: It creates dynamic dictionary list with various encoding and escaping characters.
- **Remote Code Execution wordlist**: It creates dynamic dictionary list for both unix and windows enviorment with different combinations.
- **SQL Injection wordlist**: It creates static boolean based SQLi dictionary list to help revealing vulnerable spots.
- **Http Request to JavaScript Converter**: It helps to convert Http requests to JavaScript code. This feature might be useful for digging up XSS issues more.
- **Authorization Matrix**: It creates a web page wide authorization role matrix and helps to find user related auhtorization/authentication issues.

Here is a small tutorial how to use each feature.

## Local File Inclusion/Directory Traversal wordlist
It both supports unix and windows file systems. You can generate any wordlists for the path you want. You just need to supply a file name, and that's all. 

**'Dept'** is represantion of how deep the wordlist should be. You can generates word list 'till/equal to' this number.

**'Waf Bypass'** asks for if you want to include all bypass features, like null bytes, different encoding, etc.

## Remote Code Execution wordlist
It creates command exection word list for the command you supply. It combines different sepetator and terminator for unix and windows enviorments.

## SQL Injection wordlist
It is for boolean based SQLi attacks and you dont need to supply any inputs. It generates static, vendor-neutral true and false criterias with escaping chacters and is appliaple for Mysql, Mssql, Oracle, Mariadb, PostgreSQL, etc. tests.

## Http Request to JavaScript Converter
The feature is for converting Http requests to JavaScript language. It might be useful to dig up XSS issues and bypass header restrictions like CSP.

To access it, right click the Http request, extensions, agartha, copy as JavaScript.

It will automaticly save it to your clipboard with some remarks. 
```
Http request in JavaScript:
	<script>var xhr=new XMLHttpRequest();xhr.open('POST','http://vm:80/dvwa/login.php');xhr.withCredentials=true;xhr.setRequestHeader('Content-type','application/x-www-form-urlencoded');xhr.send('username=admin&password=pwd1234&Login=Login');</script>

For redirection, please also add before '</script>' tag:
	xhr.onreadystatechange=function(){if (this.status===302){var location=this.getResponseHeader('Location');return ajax.call(this,location);}};

To use in Developer Tools Console, you should remove 'script' tags.
```
